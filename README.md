# Real-Time-Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition
The Number Plate Recognition project aims to identify and read license plates in images or videos. This README offers an overview of the project, including its features, instructions, for setup and guidelines, for usage.



1.Introduction


License Plate Recognition (LPR) is a field that combines computer vision and machine learning to extract license plate information from images or video frames       automatically. The goal of this project is to create a user flexible platform, for performing license plate recognition tasks



2.Features


Finding license plates in images or video frames is a task. Once the license plates are detected we can extract the characters from them. To achieve recognition we rely on machine learning models. Our system is flexible. Can work with types of media including images, videos and live camera feeds. Additionally it provides a foundation, for incorporating features such, as adding timestamps.
